## 💡 Philosophy

> *"The best ML systems balance technical sophistication with operational excellence. Success requires not just state-of-the-art models, but robust platforms with proper observability, governance, and deployment strategies. My role is to architect these systems while coaching teams to maintain high standards for latency, cost, and compliance."*

**From research to production**: Bridging the gap between cutting-edge ML research (Ph.D.) and business strategy (EMBA) to build systems that create measurable impact at scale.
